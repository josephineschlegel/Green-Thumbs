        <p class="homeText" id="whoWe">We are a group of 5 univeristy students studying Multimedia Desing. Our goal is to engage teenagers to start a campaign, so they can be more aware of climate change and be a part of saving the future. We are doing this by making a campaign website and videos to inspire the younger target audience to do something for climate change.
        </p>
        <p class="homeText">
            Our concept is simple. Whoever you are, whoever you are with, you can make a change by doing a campaign that takes just a few minutes and minimal effort. At the same time, your action helps the climate change and shape a better future for our planet.

            <p class="homeText">
                The oceans produce half of our oxygen and food for a billion people. And because they soak up huge amounts of carbon dioxide, they’re also one of our best defenses against climate change. Our fate is bound to the fate of our oceans. If they don’t make it, we don’t either.

            <p class="homeText">
                The simple fact is companies are still creating massive amounts of waste that the planet just can’t digest. And they still have no meaningful plan to reduce their overall production of plastic packaging. This has to stop.

            <p class="homeText">
                <p class="homeText">Right now, most of us don’t know where our food comes from. A small handful of powerful corporations control nearly every aspect of our food system, depleting our environment, fueling climate change, and leaving consumers with little choice over what they eat. It’s time for an eco-food revolution.
